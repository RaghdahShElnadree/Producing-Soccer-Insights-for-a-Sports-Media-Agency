"This project focuses on analyzing and classifying Arabic comparative sentences using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It aims to distinguish between comparative and non-comparative sentences, as well as subcategories such as equative, superlative, and gradable comparisons. The project integrates preprocessing for Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian dialect, applies lexicon-based methods, and experiments with classification models including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN."
